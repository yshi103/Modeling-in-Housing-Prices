# 🏠 Housing Price Modeling in R

This project analyzes the determinants of housing prices using real estate data. It combines statistical modeling and machine learning approaches to evaluate how property characteristics—such as size, lot area, and amenities—influence sale prices.

## 🔍 Overview

- Perform exploratory data analysis on housing features  
- Apply multiple linear regression (OLS) with transformed variables  
- Implement a Random Forest model for predictive comparison  
- Interpret model performance and policy relevance

## 📁 Files

- `Modeling-in-Housing-Prices.pdf`: Main policy-style write-up with regression + Random Forest analysis  
- `An_Analysis_for_Modeling_in_Housing_Prices.pdf`: Automatically generated full knit PDF output from RMarkdown  
- `Modeling in Housing Prices.Rmd`: Source code and full modeling workflow  
- `model_script.R`: Extracted sample R script to assist GitHub language detection  
- `README.md`: General Guide

## 🧠 Methods

- Linear regression with log-transformed variables  
- Stepwise selection and multicollinearity check (VIF)  
- Random Forest with 500 trees (90.46% variance explained)  
- Cross-validation and model performance diagnostics

## 📌 Takeaways

- Square footage and lot size are major drivers of price  
- Random Forest improves prediction but sacrifices interpretability  
- Policy implications center on zoning, land use, and housing supply elasticity
